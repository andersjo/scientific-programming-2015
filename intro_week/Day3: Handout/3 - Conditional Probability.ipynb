    "We have seen an example. Suppose you are rolling a die, and you know that the roll comes up odd. What is the probability that you get a 5? \n",
    "\n",
    "Before knowing that the roll comes up odd, the chance of getting a 5 (event A = \"roll is a 5\") is $1/6$. However,  \n",
    " ***given*** the information that the roll turned up odd (B), only three possibilities are left: {$1,3,5$}, and each is equally likely. Therefore P(roll is 5|odd) = $1/3$ = $0.33$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, knowing that some event happens can change the probability of an event, given this information.\n",
