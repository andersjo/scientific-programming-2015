    "Three lost souls stand quietly on the shore of the river Styx, guarded by five devils. All are waiting to enter the inner realms of Hell. At the pier the boat lies ready for the journey, but no-one is told to climb on. In the wrinkly and scorched skin of the senior devil, a nervous complexion is visible. \n",

    "The devils are faced with a conondrum. Only three passengers can be transported by the boat at one time, and it cannot pass the river empty. Not trusting the lost souls, the devils agree that there should always be at least as many of them as there are souls, whether on the boat or on either side of the shore. The souls are after all in Hell for a reason. Also, the devils are rather keen to avoid the humilation of being overpowered and the dread of the usual punishment for losing a lost soul: spending *yet another* eternity in Hell. \n",
