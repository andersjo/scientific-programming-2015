    "In this first part of the homework you will be constructing your very own photographic mosaic. A photographic mosaic is an image where the pixels (or rather small patches) have been replaced by tiny but complete images. In other words, the image is made out of other images. It is a cute idea and delightfully meta, so it is no wonder it is very popular on the internet. People have, for instance, created an image of a character from [Harry Potter](http://orig04.deviantart.net/d3f5/f/2010/320/7/4/deathy_hallows_snape___mosaic_by_smallrinilady-d330420.jpg) made out of frames from the movies. \n",

    "First some terminology. In the homework we refer to the overall image as the *background image*. In the example above, this would be Harry Potter. The tiny images, which are building blocks for the background image, are *replacement images*, since they replace parts of the background image. These would be the frames of the movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of the mosaic is split into two tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Make tiles**. Divide the background image into tiles. You can think of each tile as a separate, smaller image.\n",
