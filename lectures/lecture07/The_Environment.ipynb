    "====\n",

    "So far, we have exclusively used Python to manipulate files, and used the shell only to open `ipython`. However, the shell can give you a range of excellent tools to manipulate (text) files. We wil introduce the basics here. Each of those tools was designed to do one specific thing, and do it really well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of the shell is that you can string different tools together in a pipeline. Say, run a python script on a file, write the output to another file, and pass that one on to an external classification tool (for example **Vowpal Wabbit**). These pipelines can be stored as scripts, and then executed as often as you want. They can take parameters and are a useful tool if you work on a larger project, because you can run the same pipeline with different settings without having to write all commands by hand each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As powerful as the shell is, it unfortunately does not run under Windows or the DOS shell, only on Mac and Linux. If you are using a Windows machine, you can install an environment like `cygwin` that simulates the shell.\n",
